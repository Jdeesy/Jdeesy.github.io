    Accomplishment, achievement, challenge, creativity, effectiveness, free time, pleasure are some of the values that come to mind when I have been satisfied. I find that I try to live up to these values as best as I can. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Challenge is an interesting value. It's not really one you can create your own, unless you just seek challenging situation. I personally like free time and relaxing so I am not one that goes out of my way to be in challenging situations. I do love challenge though. In many situations in my life (such as gaming or work), I love to be challenged. I love the feel of being pressured or beaten and then coming through to overcome that challenge. Its one of the best feelings.

    I can't really think of the last topic someone asked for my advice on. I don't think I would rely on my values to give advice to someone. I think to give good advice you should give it for the individual. You should know the personality well enough to give advice that would be the best for them. I am usually analytical in situations that need someone to make a decision, so I will usually give someone many options or the "best" advice for a situation. I might say what I would do in the situation but only after giving them many options to choose from.

    We are supposed to discuss how we feel when we think about these values. I don't really feel anything, I'm just like "Cool, I identify with the values". Thats about it. To me these values don't matter right now. There is nothing that I am doing right now that will affect how these values apply in my life. I can understand when a problem comes up these values may affect my decision, but right now they do nothing. I also don't see them being effective with stereotype threat either. In last week's blog, we talk about stereotype threat. Like I said last week, I don't really think stereotype threat affects me too often and I don't think these values would really help against it.
