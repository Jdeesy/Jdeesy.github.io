      Earlier this week, I was working on the pairing challenge of creating a blog template. During this challenge my partner asked me what the difference between inline, block and inline-block. Off the top of my head I couldn’t describe what the difference was in words. I knew what they did, I had used them in my solo challenge, but I couldn’t express what they did properly. So that is why I am writing this blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      First lets understand the difference between inline and block. Displaying elements inline means that they arranged <span class:"bold">in</span> the same <span>line</span>. Not only that but inline elements  <span class:"italicize">cannot</span> have a height, width or a vertical margin. Now lets talk about block. Displaying elements with block means you are <span class:"bold">blocking</span> them off from other elements, it is putting a break in to separate it from other elements. Unlike inline, elements with block can have a height, width, and a vertical margin. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inline-block takes the best of both worlds. It allows you to display elements on the same line while still allowing them to have  a height, width, and a vertical margin. An example of how you can use this would be to place buttons all on the same line, while giving them a height and width of 100 pixels. I hope that this gives you a better understanding of how inline, block, and inline-block work.
