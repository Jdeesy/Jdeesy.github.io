  			<h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
  			<p>Pair programming or peer-pairing is where you and another programmer work together to program a project. This allows a collaboration of idea and to help one another when stuck. Usually during these sessions one person will be the driver and one will be the navigator, which I'll talk about in a little bit.</p>

  			<h3>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h3>
  			<p>Pair programming is important to DBC because in many cases you will be working with multiple people during a project. This will be good practice for the future. Not only that but this is another way to learn and teach programming.</p>

  			<h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
  			<p>Driver and navigator are the two roles each programmer uses during the pair programming. How the roles are defined are different for each person. For me, I define a driver as the person at the keyboard. They are the one entering in the code. The navigator is the the person that watches. They are the one making sure we stay on track, correct any error, and gives directions if needed.</p>

  			<h3>Reflection</h3>
  			<p>This is the area where I will put my reflection. For this GPS I worked by myself with my guide, Gary, watching. I had a peer that was schedule to join me but had to cancel an hour before we began. Even though I was by myself I found the session enjoyable. I found that talking out loud to Gary while working helped get my thoughts out, and it was good practice for when I have a pair with me. I ask Gary a few questions about a few CSS things, and he would ask me question about my understanding and give me best practice tips.</p>
