    <h1>My Thinking Style</h1>
    <h2>How to Best Use my Thinking Style</h2>

  <p>
  When we were doing the DevBootCamp prep work we all took this test to figure out what type of learner we are. <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> Here is the test</a> if you want to take it for yourself. My test scores were a 48 in abstract sequential, a 32 for abstract random, closely followed by 24 in concrete random, and lastly a 16 in concrete sequential. At the time this didn't mean much. I mean on the test site itself, it only give a sentence definition of what each means. This week, however, we are supposed to write this blog and they have given us an additional source of what all that mean. <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">On this webpage</a> we are given a table that tells us more about each thinking style. A lot of what falls under abstract sequential, and concrete random; such as wanting to be heard, working alone, experimentation, trial-and-error, and many more. I also see that I have a lot in common with abstract random but to a lesser extent; such as listening, focusing on the issues at hand, among others.  I can see specific examples of these traits in my life.
  </p>
  <p>
  So how do I make it so I can get the most out of these thinking styles? Well I am an abstract sequential thinker, I learn best at being able to work alone. What I have been doing for the past two weeks is that I complete the challenge (or most of them) by myself. This allows me to learn the material and spend as much time on it as I would like. I then pair up with someone and help or teach them about the exercise. I think teaching someone else helps reinforce the material.        
  </p>
  <p>
  This method has been working so far. But I need to work on some areas to become a more rounded learner. I need to start being more comfortable with learning along side someone else. I have a problem where if I am just thrown into a situation (when it comes to learning or problem solving), I feel rushed and like I am being pressured. In these times, I usually rely on my intuition to get me through them, which isn't always good because I don't take the time to analyze everything. I need to work on being able not feel pressured so that I am able to analyze everything. I also need to work on being able to communicate with my partner how I am feeling, and that I may need to 'step back' to clear my head and to think.
