      <p class="lead">In Reign: Legend of Godric we follow the tale of our young hero Godric. His tale begins when he releases an ancient evil that had been sealed away by his ancestors. He must lead his followers in order to stop this evil from spreading.</p>
      <p class="lead">Reign: Legend of Godric was a turn based strategy game for Android and iOS. It was built by a team of five. The goal of this project was to finish in one school year, and to get it deployed on the app stores. I am happy to say we accomplished this goal.</p>

      <p class="lead">Fly through space, dodge bullets, and shoot down missiles. What more can you ask for? Upgrades of course! Try out Space Adventure and you will get all of this and more.</p>
      <p class="lead">Space Adventure was created during a game jam. We had a team of about eight people, who designed and built the game in 48 hours. It was a 2.5D sidescroller, where you were the pilot of a spaceship. You had to fly over a city while they shot at you and launched missiles.</p>
